# AkOS

Learning C++ and Assembly language while I create a basic operating system for Raspberry Pi. 

Named it AK OS because I live in Alaska.

## Directions

There are two source code folders based off of two tutorials. I am working on an 
M1 Mac so QEMU doesn't work and many of the book's lexer commands are outdated. 
So I am doing another tutorial to see how it works in another context with more 
updating to better understand the whole process.
